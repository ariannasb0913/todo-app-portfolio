# TODO App Portfolio

<p>A simple TODO app that allows users to add new tasks and filter by name.</p>

<p>On the main page is a list of tasks, with some marked as complete or incomplete by a checkbox. Once a task is marked as complete, the task is then striked through with red.</p>

<p>Underneath of the task list is an add item component, which takes user input based on a brief description and then adjusts the state of the tasks array to include the new incomplete task.</p>

<p>Under the add new task component is a filter component, which takes user imput and compares two strings: the user input and the description of the task.</p>
